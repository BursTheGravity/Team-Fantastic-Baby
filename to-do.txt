MAIN THINGS TO GET DONE:

Leo:

- MERGE OLD EXECUTE/NEW EXECUTE IDEA BEFORE DOING OTHERS
	- test in diff file

- Wild Pokemon
	- Only attacks
	- Randomly uses one of its moves

- Pokemon Battles:
	- Check speed to see who goes first (?)
	- How does a battle end?
		- Enemy faints
			- User gains exp
			- Pokemon evolving after battle
		- Player blacks out
			- User's Pokemon faint -> select new pokemon
		- Enemy is caught
			- No exp gained
			- Asks for nickname (low priority)

- Pokemon
	- Keeping track of when pkmn is fainted
	- Pkmn can only revive at pkcenter
		- Pkmn cannot use potion at hp=0
	- Add hard-coded moves for evolutions (*Do last/semi-last*)

- Implement Trainers
	- var defeated?
	- Vision of trainers = straight line
	- Player walks into vision -> battle
	- if trainer hasn't been defeated yet, trainer walks up to player & fights them
	*GYM LEADERS only fight when prompted by trainer
		- after defeat, trainer is rewarded an item
		- gym leaders can use potion once per pkmn
	- if player tries to catch pokemon
		- player throws pkball
		- but since wild = false, pkball misses, trainer loses turn

Sungbin:

- Add different blocks in map
	- Grass	^^^
	- Tree (cuttable)	.T.
	- Rock (smashable)	o0o
	- Wall (cannot break)	|| ---
	- Portals into next/prev rooms [_]
	- TRAINERS/GYM LEADERS/ELITE FOUR *later
	- PokeCenter (create save spot for player to respawn if dead)
	- PokeMart
		- Do we want player to go inside PokeMart and then talk to 
			someone at desk to open up shop?
		- Same idea can be for Pokecenter?
	- Wild items to pick up (pokeballs, potions, etc; disappears after)
	- also maybe a Key to show which symbols mean what
	- have names for maps in top corner (Route 101, Newleaf City, etc.)
		- ^^^ = grass
		- vTv = tree
		- oO0 = rock
		- || -- __ = walls
		- P = pkcenter
		- M = pkmart
		- [_]= portal
		- o = pokeball (hard-coded item; disappears after being taken)
		- + different things for diff types of trainers
	- IMPLEMENT CONTROL "X" TO INTERACT WITH BLOCK/PLAYER IN FRONT (use direction)
		- Prompt trainer battles
		- Cut/smash rocks/trees
		- Pick up Items (pokeballs)

- Implement PokeCenters/PokeMart
	- Stand on PokeCenter to restore all Pokemon to full hp
		- Make player wait a moment to restore Pokemon hp
	- Stand on PokeMart to open store to buy items
		- Just add items into inventory.java while removing money
		- Ability to go "Back" to get out of store

EXTRA THINGS:

- Start menu in map
	- List of Pokemon
		- Rearrange Pokemon? (Pick a Pokemon to Swap + Pick to swap with)
		- Pokemon.about()
	- View bags
	- View profile (Only button to press in thsi screen is b)
