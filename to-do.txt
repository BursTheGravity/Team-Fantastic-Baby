MAIN THINGS TO GET DONE:

Leo:

- Implement Trainers
	- Player walks into vision -> battle
	*GYM LEADERS only fight when prompted by trainer
		- after defeat, trainer is rewarded an item (?)
		
- Different maps have different Pokemon in evolution tree
		
- When done with everything, fix math for:
	- Exp gain
	- Damage dealt (effectiveness)
	- Pokeball catch rate
	- Escape rate
	- PokeMart prices
	- Speed (?)
	- get rid of FOR TESTING displays

Sungbin:

- Add different blocks in map
	- Grass	^^^
	- Tree (cuttable)	.T.
	- Rock (smashable)	o0o
	- Wall (cannot break)	|| ---
	- Portals into next/prev rooms [_]
	- TRAINERS/GYM LEADERS/ELITE FOUR *later
	- PokeCenter (create save spot for player to respawn if dead)
	- PokeMart
		- Do we want player to go inside PokeMart and then talk to 
			someone at desk to open up shop?
		- Same idea can be for Pokecenter?
	- Wild items to pick up (pokeballs, potions, etc; disappears after)
	- also maybe a Key to show which symbols mean what
	- have names for maps in top corner (Route 101, Newleaf City, etc.)
		- ^^^ = grass
		- vTv = tree
		- oO0 = rock
		- || -- __ = walls
		- P = pkcenter
		- M = pkmart
		- [_]= portal
		- o = pokeball (hard-coded item; disappears after being taken)
		- + different things for diff types of trainers
	- IMPLEMENT CONTROL "X" TO INTERACT WITH BLOCK/PLAYER IN FRONT (use direction)
		- Prompt trainer battles
		- Cut/smash rocks/trees
		- Pick up Items (pokeballs)

- Implement PokeCenters/PokeMart
	- Stand on PokeCenter to restore all Pokemon to full hp
		- Make player wait a moment to restore Pokemon hp
	- Stand on PokeMart to open store to buy items
		- Just add items into inventory.java while removing money
		- Ability to go "Back" to get out of store

	In Map:
		- DisplayMap
		- Enter a Control
		- If interact:
			- This tree looks like it can be cut down. 
				- Use/don't have cut
			- **You picked up a HM01(Cut) (?) or have this happen after gym battles
