To-Do: Things we want to complete after submission of project:

- Game balancing:
	- Easier exp gain with only 13 maps
	- Easier to fight against super effective Pokemon
	
- Double types:
	- Pokemon can have 2 types, not just 1
	
- Moves:
	- Every move has a different type
	- Every move has different base damage (power)
	- Every move has an accuracy
	- Add moves with different effects, not just damage (?)
	
- Statuses:
	- Sleep
	- Paralyzed
	- Frozen
	- Burnt
	- Flinched (Lose 1 turn once)
	
- Encountering multiple legendary Pokemon at different areas:
	- Different maps specifically for different legendaries:
	Ex: Groudon -- http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Terra_Cave
	Kyogre -- http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Marine_Cave
	Rayquaza -- http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sky_Pillar
	- Add all legendaries (at least all from one region: Hoenn!)
	
- 8 Gym leaders, Elite Four, Champion:
	Hoenn: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hoenn#Gym_Leaders
	http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hoenn#Elite_Four_and_Champion
	
- Double Battles (?)
	- Send out 2 Pokemon at once vs two Pokemon
	
- Stats:
	- More personalized stats for different Pokemon so everyone won't have same stats
	- Include speed to use to determine who goes first whenever a Pokemon is sent out
	- Add special attack/defense
	
- Items:
	- Add berries
	- Add all other HM/TM's (8 HM's in total, 92 TM's)
	- Add more potions, Poke balls, battle items
	- Add equip items that have different effects depending on the item
