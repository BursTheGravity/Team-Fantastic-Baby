FINAL TO DO:

- Start msg wait times
	- in startupMsg() just add waitMS(???) in between lines if u want
	so it doesn't just splatter out a whole bunch of text
	- or u can have like displayMessage() and make it look pretty
	
- Beating the game (at the bottom of game.java, badges == 4)
	- have a message print out some congratulations thing
	
- Interact with block in front (Cut tree, Smash rock)
	- search for 'command.equals("x")' in file and implement
	checking block in front. 
	cut key item = "HM01--Cut"
	rock smash key item = "HM06--Rock Smash"
	
- Adding trainers:
	- if regular trainer, just use function trainerBattleStart(false);
	- if gym leader/champion, just use function trainerBattleStart(true);
	
- Make it so maps need rock smash/cut to get to portal so u need to beat gym leader

- Make gym leader more visible? i was kinda confused when the (!) was a gym leader
	maybe put some empty tiles around him so he is noticeable
	
- game.java -> spawnPokemon -> int lvl takes care of level of pokemon in each map

- Change any testing values back (ex: starting map)
